Project Description

A fitness chain has gyms at 5 different locations in the central New Jersey area:

Bridgewater, 08807, Somerset County Edison, 08837, Middlesex County Franklin, 08873, Somerset County Piscataway, 08854, Middlesex County Somerville, 08876, Somerset County

Your team will develop a simple software to help the fitness chain manages the gym memberships and fitness class schedules. The initial phase is to provide a console-based interactive user interface to process the operations in command lines and display the results. A command line begins with the operation the user needed to perform followed by the data tokens to complete the operation. An operation will be represented with a single character or two-character uppercase letters. The operation code and the data tokens will be delimited by spaces in a command line. The operation code is case-sensitive, which means operation codes with lowercase letters should be rejected by the software.

The initial requirement for the software is to provide the following functionalities:

<ol>
<li>(1) &nbsp;Add member information to the member database. Each member is uniquely identified by their first name, last name, and date of birth. A membership has an expiration date and a specified gym location. A member must be 18 or older to join.</li>
<li>(2) &nbsp;Remove member information from the member database; for simplicity, members who want to cancel the membership will be removed from the database.</li>
<li>(3) &nbsp;Display the list of members sorted by last and first name OR sorted by county and zip code OR sorted by the expiration date, in ascending order.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column"></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
(4) Members must check in for the online fitness classes. Regardless of the membership locations, as long as their memberships have not expired, they can check in any online fitness classes happening the day of checking in. Some of the online fitness classes may be holding at the same time, the software should check if there is a time conflict when the members are checking in. Currently, the fitness chain offers the following online fitness classes on a daily basis.

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
To provide the above functionalities, the operation codes at the beginning of the command lines are listed below.

<ul>
<li>A command, to add a member to the member database. Data needed to add a member includes member‚Äôs first and last name, date of birth, membership expiration date and location (in city name) of the gym membership. Below is a sample command line for add a member. You can assume that the user will always enter enough data tokens to add a member in the format shown below.
<pre>      A April March 3/31/1990 6/30/2023 Piscataway
</pre>
The above command line starts with the A command, followed by the member‚Äôs first name, last name, date of birth, membership expiration date, and the city name identifying the gym location. The dates shall be given in mm/dd/yyyy format. The names and locations are NOT case-sensitive, that is, April March and april march are the same person as long as the dates of birth are also the same; PISCATAWAY and Piscataway represent the same location. The user can enter an expired membership date. Human errors are very common. Your software shall provide certain degree of reliability and shall not allow the member be added to the database if the data tokens in the command line have the following conditions.

o Any date that is not a valid calendar date

o The date of birth is today or a future date

o A member who is less than 18 years old

o An invalid city name, that is, the gym location doesn‚Äôt exist
</li>
<li>R command, to cancel the membership and remove the specified member from the database, for example, R Paul Siegel 5/1/1999
The above command line removes the member from the database. Your software must reject if the user is removing a non-existing member.
</li>
<li>P command, to display the list of members in the database without sorting (current order in the array.)</li>
<li>PC command, to display the list of members in the database ordered by the county names and then the zip codes;
that is, if the locations are in the same county, ordered by the zip codes.
</li>
<li>PN command, display the list of members in the database ordered by the members‚Äô last names and then first names;
that is, if two members have the same last name, ordered by the first name.
</li>
<li>PD command, display the list of members in the database ordered by the expiration dates. If two expiration dates
are the same, their order doesn‚Äôt matter.
</li>
<li>S command, display the fitness class schedule. A fitness class shall include the fitness class name, instructor‚Äôs
name, the time of the class, and the list of members who have already checked in today. For simplicity, assuming the schedule is for ‚Äútoday‚Äù only, you do not need to handle a multiple-day schedule.

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
‚Ä¢ C command, for members check-in, for example, the command line to check in Pilates. C Pilates Mary Lindsey 12/1/1989

Your software shall not allow a member to check in if

o the membership has expired

o the member does not exist

o the date of birth is invalid

o the fitness class does not exist

o there is a time conflict with other fitness classes o the member has already checked in

<ul>
<li>D command, to drop the fitness classes after the member checked in to a class, for example, D Pilates Mary Lindsey 12/1/1989
Your software shall not allow the member to drop the class if the member is not checked in, or the date of birth is

invalid, or the fitness class does not exist.
</li>
<li>Q command, to stop the program execution and display ‚ÄúGym Manager terminated.‚Äù, so the user know that
your software has stopped running.

Project Requirement

<ol>
<li>You MUST follow the Coding Standard and Ground Rules posted on Canvas under Week #1 in the ‚ÄúModules‚Äù. You will lose points if you are not following the rules.</li>
<li>You are responsible for following the Academic Integrity Policy. See the Additional Note #13 in the syllabus.</li>
<li>There are test cases in the file Project1_testCases.txt for you to test your project. The associated output is listed at the end of this document for your reference. The graders will be using the sample test cases to test your project. Your project should be able to take the test cases from the console in the same order without getting any exceptions and without terminating abnormally, including the empty lines. You will lose 2 points for each incorrect output or each exception causing the project to terminate abnormally. You should create an instance of
the Scanner class to read from standard input.
</li>
<li>Each Java class must go in a separate file. -2 points if you put more than one Java class into a file.</li>
<li>Your program MUST handle bad commands; -2 points for each bad command not handled, with a maximum of
losing 6 points.
</li>
<li>You are not allowed to use any Java library classes, EXCEPT the Scanner, StringTokenizer, Calendar and
DecimalForamt class. You will lose 5 points for each additional Java library class imported, with a maximum

of losing 10 points.
</li>
<li>You are not allowed to use the Java library class ArrayList anywhere in the project, or use any classes in the
Java Collections, or you will get 0 points for this project.
</li>
<li>When you import Java library classes, be specific and DO NOT import unnecessary classes or import the whole
package. For example, import java.util.*;, this will import all classes in the java.util package. You will lose 2 points for using the asterisk ‚Äú*‚Äù to include all the Java classes in the java.util package, or other java packages, with a maximum of losing 4 points.
</li>
<li>You MUST include the Java classes below. -5 points for each class missing or NOT used. You CAN add necessary constructors, private methods (helper methods), and other public methods to each class. You should define necessary constant identifiers and do not use MAGIC NUMBERs. A good approach is to use an enum class or a public class to define all the constant names and their associated values.</li>

-2 points for each method not implemented, signature changed or not used.
</li>
<li>You CANNOT use System.out in this class, EXCEPT the four print() methods, -2 points for each
violation.
</li>
<li>The find() method searches a member in the list and returns the index if it is found, it returns -1 if the
member is not in the list. You must define a constant identifier ‚ÄúNOT_FOUND‚Äù for the value -1.
</li>
<li>The remove() method remove a member from the list. This method maintains the relative order of the
members in the list after the remove, -3 points if this is not done correctly.
</li>
<li>You must use an in-place sorting algorithm to sort the list of members in the array. That is, no additional
array can be declared for sorting, or you will lose 10 points. You must write code to implement the algorithm yourself. You CANNOT use Arrays.sort() or System.arraycopy() or any other Java library classes for sorting. You will lose 10 points if you do. The sorting algorithm you use can be ‚Äústable‚Äù or ‚Äúnot stable‚Äù.
</li>
<li>You can add constant names and additional methods if necessary. However, the methods you added must either take no parameter or has a single parameter, which takes only an instance of Member class, such as (Member member), or you will lose 2 points for each violation, see the add and remove methods as an example.
(c) GymManager class
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This class is the User Interface class to process the command lines entered o the IDE console and display
the results on the console. An instance of this class can process a single command line, and a sequence of command lines in batch. If it cannot process the command lines in batch, you will lose 10 points. This is an interactive program such that, it displays the results on the console whenever one or more command lines are entered, after the user hits the enter key.
</li>
<li>When your project starts running, it shall display ‚Äù Gym Manager running‚Ä¶‚Äù. In this case, the user would know the software is ready to read the command lines. It should continuously process the command lines until the ‚ÄúQ‚Äù command is read. That is, the ‚ÄúQ‚Äù command is the only way to terminate the software normally. Before the software stops running, display ‚Äù Gym Manager terminated.‚Äù.</li>
<li>You must define a public void run() method that includes a while loop to continuously read the command lines. You will lose 5 points if the run() method is missing. You MUST keep this method under 40 lines for readability, or you will lose 3 points. You should define necessary instance variables and private methods (helper methods) to handle different commands.
